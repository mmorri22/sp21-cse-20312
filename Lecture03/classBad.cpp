/**********************************************
* File: classBad.cpp
* Author: Matthew Morrison
* Email: matt.morrison@nd.edu
* 
* Taking the code from voidFunc and putting it into
* a C++ struct. voidFunc is the same code, but at 
* a lower level of abstraction. This code has data hiding
* and object oriented programming
*
* The class constructor defines the members out of order.
* This creates complexity similar to voidNodeBad2
*
* Running command "make classBad" will compile with warnings
*
* Running command "make classBadPQC" will use PQC rules.
* It will not compile, and force more complex errors.
*
